“There are those who say that when civilization progresses a bit further, transportation facilities will move into the skies and under the ground, and that our streets will again be quiet, but I know perfectly well that when that day comes some new device for torturing the old will be invented.”
― Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, In Praise of Shadows
 
 
The motion of the machine on display here is based on models of the nervous system developed the physicist, Shun Ichi Amiri and refined by the artists Christian Faubel and Wolfgang Spahn.
This machine is a far cry from the machines that will allegedly replace humans. The machines that will replace humans will be fast, efficient and perfect. This on the other hand, is a bundle of imperfections - nervous ticks, jerks and paranoia.
